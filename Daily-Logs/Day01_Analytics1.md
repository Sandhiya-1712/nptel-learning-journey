# Day 01 - NPTEL - Data Analytics with Python

## Introduction to Data Analytics

I. Basic terminologies used in Data Analytics:

      1. VARIABLES : variable is what we are measuring(KPI).
      Example: Revenue of a month. As revenue varies from month to month so it's a variable.
      2. MEASUREMENT : is the actual recorded value of that variable.
      Example: Revenue which has been recorded in past years. Each numeric value is one measurement.
      3. DATA : data is the collection of all measurements.
      Example: year-over-year revenue analysis.
      
II. Quantitative Vs Qualitative:

      QUANTITATIVE : answers "HOW Much ?", "HOW Many?", "HOW Often?" - It's mostly numbers, counts, measurements.
      QUALITATIVE : answers "Why?", "How?", "what kind?" - It's mostly words, categories, reasons, feedbacks (explanatory).

III. Data Analytics VS Data Analyst

      Data Analysis : It's focuses on a certain question.
              1.1 - Explain the thing how and why happened in the past - why the sales got dropped at weekends?
      Data Analytics : It uses data, tools and processes continuously to guide decisions.
              1.2 - It explores about potential future events.

IV. Classification of Data Analytics: 

      Based on the phase of workflow and the kind of analysis required, there are 4 major types
      1. Descriptive analytics - summarizes historical data using totals, averages, percentages
      2. Diagnostic analytics - Root cause analysis like it breaks a data by time, region, product, customers to explain changes.
      3. Predictive analytics - Uses historical patterns to estimate future outcomes(trends, forecast)
      4. Prescriptive analytics - It recommends action based on predictions. Example : reducing price by 5% is likely to recover70% of lost sales - strategy in simple terms.

V. Levels od Data Measurement:

      1.Nominal (Lowest level) -	classifies data into distict categories in which ranking is not  implied	
      Example : "1.gender2.Marital status"	
      Meaningful operations - classifying and counting	
      Statistical Methods :  Non-Parametric
      
      2.Ordinal	classifies data into distict categories in which ranking is implied	
      Example : Student grades - A, B, C, D	
      Meaningful operations - All of the above plus Ranking
      Statistical methods : Non-Parametric
      
      3. interval	i) difference between the measurements is a meaningful quantity
                  ii) measurement has no true zero value 
      Example : i) Temperature
                ii) year	
      Meaningful operations - All of the above plus addition and subtraction
      Statistical methods : Parametric
      4. Ratio (Highest level)	i) difference between the measurements is a meaningful quantity
                                ii) measurement has a true zero value
      Example - 1.weight, 2.age
      Meaningful operations - All of the above plus multiplication and division
      Statistical methods : Parametric
