## Central Tendency
   1. Central Tendency refers to a single value that represents the center or typical value of a dataset.
   2. It tells us where most of the data is centered.

## Why Do We Need Central Tendency?
    Imagine we have marks of 100 students. Instead of showing all 100 marks, can say it as : The average mark is 72
    " That 72 represents the central tendency of the data."

## Types of Central Tendency
    There are 3 main measures:
       1. Mean - Arithmetic average
       2. Median - Middle value
       3. Mode - Most frequent value
## Mean 
    Best when:
       1. Data is evenly distributed
       2. No extreme outliers.
       3. Applicable for interval and ratio data
       4. Not applicable for ordinal or nominal data
       5. Affected by each value in a dataset, including extreme outliers
       6. Computed by summing all values in the dataset and dividing the sum by the number of values in the dataset.
  # Population Mean (μ)
        Population mean is the average of all values in the entire population.
        If you have data of every single member, it is population data.
  # Sample Mean (x̄)
        Sample mean is the average of a subset (sample) taken from the population.
        Used when population is large.
  # Mean of Grouped Data
        Used when data is grouped in class intervals.
        It uses frequency and mid point present in the dataset.
  # Weighted Average
        Used when values have different importance (weights).
        Very important in:
             1. GPA calculation
             2. Portfolio returns
             3. KPI weighting
             4. Revenue contribution
             5. Hospital case mix
  # Trimmed Mean (Robust Average)
        Mean after removing extreme values(outliers) from both ends.
  # Geometric Mean (Growth Rates & Returns)
        Used for multiplicative data, not additive.
        Use Case: “How fast is something growing over time?”
  # Harmonic Mean (Rates & Ratios)
        Used when averaging rates, especially when denominator matters.
        Use Case : “Average of speeds, prices per unit, ratios.”
