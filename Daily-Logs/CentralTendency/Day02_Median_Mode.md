## Median
      1. Middle value in an ordered array of numbers
      2. Applicable for ordinary, interval and ratio data
      3. Not applicable for nominal data
      4. unaffected by extremely small and extremely large values (outliers)
## Computation Procedure of Median
      1. sort the array of numbers in ascending order
      2. if total number of observation is 
              2.1 - odd then median is given by (n+1)/2
              2.2 - Even then median is given by [(n/2) + ((n/2)+1)]/2 
      3. Median of grouped data
              L + [{( Total of frequencies/2) - cumulative frequency of class preceeding the median class} / { frequency of median class}] * width of median class

## Mode
     The value that occurs most frequently in given dataset

## Mode of grouped data
     L + [ { frequency of modal class (f1) - frequency of class before modal class (f0) } / 
           { 2*frequency of modal class(f1) - frequency of class before modal class(f0) - frequency of class after modal class(f2) } ] * h

### Relation between Mean, Median, Mode
      ## Mode ~ 3*Median - 2Mean
